                            In this mobile era, almost everything thing is possible with a mobile device. People are increasingly
                            using their mobile devices not only to call but to play games, to watch movies, and to track their health.
                            Having a mobile application or atleast mobile website is must for any business. I have been working with
                            Android for a year now, and I am an intermediate developer for the platform. WeMeet, and application to find
